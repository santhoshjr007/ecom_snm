# E-COMMERCE_sixninemarket
## Project Description
The Ecommerce sixnine market is designed to help developers learn the core concepts of full-stack web development by building a complete E-Commerce Application. This project will guide you through the process of creating a fully functional application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), which is a powerful and widely used set of technologies for building dynamic and scalable web applications.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview
## What is MERN Stack?
The MERN stack is a collection of JavaScript technologies that allow developers to write both client-side and server-side code in JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the technologies involved:
1. MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, allowing for scalable and easy-to-manage databases.
2. Express.js: A lightweight web framework for Node.js that simplifies building APIs and handling HTTP requests.
3. React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic UIs efficiently.
4. Node.js: A server-side JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.
This project is ideal for anyone looking to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development. By the end of the project, you'll have a clear understanding of how the backend and frontend components interact, how to design and implement RESTful APIs, how to manage data with MongoDB, and how to authenticate users securely.

Welcome to the Ecommerce MERN Stack Application project! This project is designed to help you learn how to build a full-stack e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). You will gain hands-on experience by building essential features like secure authentication, REST API creation, and database schema design.
